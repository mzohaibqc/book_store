===========================

A book Store to search books based on title, subject and author.
It shows basic details of books and their thumbnail on search.
It allows user to buy a book or more.

I have used all required things e.g. Methods, Classes , Objects, Event binding 
and AJax request to search books data from Google Book API V1.
